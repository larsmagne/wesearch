we:search is a specialized search engine/data base for dealing with huge
mail/news spools.  It's designed to be extremely fast when indexing,
to allow adding new articles to the index on-the-fly, and uses lots of
memory.

This is not a general search engine, and if you have less than a few
hundred thousand messages in your spool, there are other search
engines that give good results.  we:search is designed for indexing
tens of millions of messages.

The requirements for compiling we:search are glib 1.2+ and gmime
1.0.6+, as well as all the normal GNU tools.

A general overview of how it all works is included in the NOTES file.

This package is released under the GNU GPL, a copy of which is included.
