MainDB is a specialized search engine/data base for dealing with huge
mail/news spools.  It's designed to be extremely fast when indexing,
to allow adding new articles to the index on-the-fly, and uses lots of
memory.

This is not a general search engine, and if you have less than a few
hundred thousand messages in your spool, there are other search
engines that give good results.  MainDB is designed for indexing tens
of millions of messages.

The requirements for compiling MainDB are glib 1.2+ and gmime 1.0.6+,
as well as all the normal GNU tools.

This package is released under the GNU GPL, a copy of which is included.
